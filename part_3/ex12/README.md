#Experiment 12: Designing	and	testing	a	sinewave table in ROM

##Objective:

The objective was to produce a ROM to store sine wave values and then use the switches on the DE1 to display the value at the address given by the switches using the 7 segment displays.

##Results

We created the ROM and populated its contents with the values we were given which represented a sine wave. We downloaded and used the .mif file to initialize the ROM that we generated with in the IP Catalog of size 1024x10bit. We tested our designed display below, and it worked as we expected displaying the correct values from the ROM on the 7-segment displays corresponding to the input.
