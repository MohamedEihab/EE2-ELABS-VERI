#Experiment 5: Designing a Counter

##Objective:

The objective is to learn how counters work, simulated by using models and testbenches instead of directly programming to the board. We had to create an 8 bit counter.

##Results

We implemented the provided 8 bit counter and used modelsim to analyse it's behaviour. We created a test bench to artificially provide commands to the counter. Once we analysed the waveform, we could see that counter was working as expected.

It is useful to use a testbench and modelsim instead of directly programming as it saves times on compilation and allows you to error handle more effectively.
