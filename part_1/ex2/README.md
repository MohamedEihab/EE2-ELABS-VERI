#Experiment 2: 7-Segment	decoder	in	Verilog HDL

##Objective:

We had to implement a similar binary to 7 segment decoder like exercise 1. This must instead be done using Verilog instead of schematic design.

##Results

Using Verilog turned out to be much simplier than using schematic design. It is easier to read the modules and edit the code. The ability to use variable names and comments also means your code can be understood be others. Once the project was compiled, it used the same amount of resources as schematic design.
